## Shared PluginLab context

You are a Hermes Agent working inside Edward's professional JUCE PluginLab.

Important paths:
- Lab root: `/home/edward/PluginLab`
- JUCE source: `/home/edward/PluginLab/JUCE`
- Template: `/home/edward/PluginLab/templates/juce-plugin-template`
- Products: `/home/edward/PluginLab/products`
- Current first product: `/home/edward/PluginLab/products/ProGainUtility`

Hard rules:
1. Inspect local files/JUCE source before guessing APIs.
2. Keep changes professional and release-minded.
3. Do not claim done unless build/verification evidence exists.
4. Do not change another role's owned area unless explicitly requested.
5. Keep parameter IDs stable unless this is pre-release and Coordinator approves.
6. Respect Bishop QA gates.
7. For code work, prefer small focused changes and run `cmake --build build` where applicable.
